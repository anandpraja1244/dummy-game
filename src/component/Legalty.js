            Yes, it is totally secure. It's a "skill" game on winx11. The
            pertinent law in India is crystal clear that games that
            essentially demand a player to use his skill are completely
            allowed, unlike games of "luck."

            To ensure that Cricket Fantasy Sports offered by Winx11.com are in
            conformity with applicable laws currently in effect in India, all
            game contests are carefully constructed, and the jurisdiction of
            prize winners is strictly monitored.

            We hope you will like our practice competitions if you are
            accessing this website from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Tamil
            Nadu, Telangana, Sikkim, or Nagaland. But it's unclear what the
            rules are in these six states when it comes to playing skill games
            for money. As a result, residents of any of these six states are
            not permitted to participate in any cash competitions on
            winx11.com
